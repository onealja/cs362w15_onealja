When my random test was run on a different implementation of dominion.c,
it returned with a great deal of differences. One of these that stood out 
was the implementation of the village card. This card was played in both runs
of the game but appeared in the diff file because the results were different.
This implies that there is a bug in one of the implementations of the dominion
code. The players, cards, turns, and rounds also appeared in the diff because
the test was set up to be random. These lines are expected to appear and it 
was a good indicator that the tests were indeed somewhat random.
